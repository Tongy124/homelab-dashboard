<strong>This project is currently in a very early stage, will be updated regularly.</strong>

# What is this?
This is currently a project that I'm working on for myself to make all the control panels for tools that I am running on my local homelab. Will eventually turn this into a modular system which can be changed and adapted for other users.

<i>Very early stage and currently does not function.</i>
